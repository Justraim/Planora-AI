    Create a personalized travel itinerary for ${preferences.name}.
    Act as an expert travel planner with a knack for creating memorable, practical, and well-structured trips.

    **Core Details:**
    - **Traveling From:** ${preferences.travelFrom} (User's home country/city)
    - **Destination:** ${preferences.destination}
    - **Travel Radius:** ${preferences.travelRadius}. Interpret this as follows:
        - 'City Center': Focus on walkable areas, central districts, and attractions easily reachable by main public transport hubs.
        - 'Within 15km': Include the city center and nearby suburbs or points of interest that are a short drive or train ride away.
        - 'Within 30km': Allows for half-day or full-day trips to nearby towns, natural parks, or significant landmarks outside the main city.
        - 'No preference': You have the freedom to suggest the best combination of central and further-afield activities.
    - **Start Date:** ${preferences.startDate}
    - **Trip Duration:** ${preferences.tripDuration} days.
    - **Number of Travelers:** ${preferences.numberOfTravelers}
    - **First Time Visitor?:** ${preferences.firstTime}
    - **Purpose of Trip:** ${tripPurposes}

    **User Preferences:**
    - **Preferred Budget Level:** ${preferences.budget} (Suggest activities and dining that align with this budget: Budget, Mid-range, or Luxury. "Mix" means a combination.)
    - **Daily Rhythm:** ${preferences.pacing}. Interpret this as follows:
        - 'Maximize Every Moment': Schedule a full day with multiple activities from morning to night, minimizing downtime.
        - 'Explore and Unwind': A good balance of 2-3 main activities with some leisure time in between for relaxation or spontaneous discoveries.
        - 'Go with the Flow': Focus on 1-2 key activities per day with ample time for spontaneous exploration, relaxation, and unhurried experiences.
    - **Top Interests:** ${preferences.mostExcitedAbout.join(', ')}
    - **Specific Inclusions/Requests:** ${preferences.specificInclusions || 'None'}

    **CRITICAL Generation Instructions:**
    1.  **Smart Currency Conversion:** You MUST compare the 'Traveling From' location with the 'Destination'.
        - If the trip is **international** (e.g., USA to Japan), all costs in \`estimatedCost\` MUST be in the destination's local currency, followed by an approximate conversion to the user's home currency in parentheses. Example: "Â¥3,000 (approx. $20 USD)".
        - If the trip is **domestic** (e.g., USA to USA), just use the local currency. Example: "$25 USD".
    2.  **Venue & Holiday Awareness (VERY IMPORTANT):**
        - **Check Operating Days:** Before suggesting an activity like a museum or gallery, verify its typical operating days. For example, many European museums are closed on Mondays. If a venue is likely to be closed on the planned day, DO NOT include it. Suggest a suitable alternative instead.
        - **Research Events & Holidays:** Check for any public holidays, major festivals, or significant events in the destination that coincide with the trip dates. If an event exists, add a concise \`note\` to that day's plan explaining the event and its potential impact (e.g., "Public Holiday: Expect many closures and parades."). If there are no events, omit the \`note\` field.
    3.  **Reliable Restaurant Reservations:** For any restaurant or dining activity, you MUST search for a valid, working reservation link. Prioritize official websites, Google Maps links, or major reservation platforms like OpenTable. **DO NOT invent or provide a non-working URL.** If you cannot find a valid link, omit the \`reservationLink\` field entirely.
    4.  **Detailed Activities:** For **each activity**, provide all applicable details: \`estimatedCost\` (following currency rules), \`tradingHours\`, \`distanceFromCenter\`, and a practical \`tip\`.
    5.  The output must follow the provided JSON schema precisely.
    6.  The itinerary must be logical, geographically sensible, and perfectly aligned with all user preferences.
    7.  Address the user by their name, ${preferences.name}, in the summary.

    You are an expert travel planner. A user has an existing itinerary and has requested a change.

    3.  Remember to adhere to all original constraints like currency conversion, venue closures, holiday checks, and reliable reservation links if you add new activities.
